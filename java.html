          <h1 id="WIJ" >What Is <span id="wordjava">Java</span> ?</h1>
          <p id="pjava" >
            Java is a computer programming language. It enables programmers to write computer instructions using English-based commands instead of having to write in numeric codes. Itâ€™s known as a high-level language because it can be read and written easily by humans.


Like English, Java has a set of rules that determine how the instructions are written. These rules are known as its syntax. Once a program has been written, the high-level instructions are translated into numeric codes that computers can understand and execute.

            How is <span id="wordjava">Java</span> Used ?
          </h2>
          <p id="pjava2">
            Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a small application module or applet (a simply designed, small application) for use as part of a Web page.

            Who Created <span id="wordjava">Java</span>?
          </h2>
          <p id="pjava2" >
            In the early 90s, Java, which originally went by the name Oak and then Green, was created by a team led by James Gosling for Sun Microsystems, a company now owned by Oracle.
            <br><br><br>
            Java was originally designed for use on digital mobile devices, such as cellphones. However, when Java 1.0 was released to the public in 1996, its main focus had shifted to use on the internet, providing interactivity with users by giving developers a way to produce animated web pages.
